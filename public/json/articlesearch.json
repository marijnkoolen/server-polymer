I love funding, but I want to see it done efficiently and with the minimum of hypocrisy. What good is it for the heads of Exxon and MCA to hand big checks to the officials of Yale and Boston Univerisities if at the same time, and on the same campuses, recruiters from Exxon and MCA are telling our humanities majors that their education has been wasted?
